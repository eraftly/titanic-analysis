Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset - Data Science Project ðŸš¢ðŸ’»

Welcome to my first project on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)! In this project, I analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover key insights related to survival rates and demographic factors.

What I did in this project:
- Explored the structure of the data and performed a statistical summary.-
- Handled missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.
- Visualized relationships between features such as gender, age, and survival rate.
- Gained insights that will help improve future data modeling.

This project is part of my learning journey at dibimbing.id's Faculty of Data - Digital Skill Fair #38. It's been an exciting experience exploring the Titanic dataset and applying real-world data science techniques using Python.
